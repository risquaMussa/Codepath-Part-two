- [x ] **The web app includes a summary page of all the user’s added crewmatese**
  -  The web app contains a summary page dedicated to displaying all the crewmates the user has made so far
  -  The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created crewmates appear at the top
- [x ] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the list of crewmates in the summary page**
  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate
  - Users can see the current attributes of their crewmate on the update form
  - After editing the crewmate's attribute values using the form, the user can immediately see those changes reflected in the update form and on the summary page 
- [x ] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**

    - Users can navigate to to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [x ] A section of the summary page, displays summary statistics about a user’s crew on their crew page
  - e.g., the percent of members with a certain attribute
